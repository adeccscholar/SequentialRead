# SequentialRead
Example for the evolution of C++ to read a sequantial file with C++

This project contains the prepared examples for the lecture "Evolution of C++ using a (very) simple example". The task was to read in a larger sequential file in the national character set.

There are several variants showing the evolution, each provided for Embarcadero and Visual Studio. Thereby the independent parts are in separate folders, and should also be usable with any other C++ compiler.

The used file is about 10 years old and was provided in the context of OpenData under the license "Datenlizenz Deutschland - Namensnennung - Version 2.0" https://www.govdata.de/dl-de/by-2-0. It still contains the internationally used WGS84 coordinates.
